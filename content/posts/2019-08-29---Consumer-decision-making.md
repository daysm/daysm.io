# Introduction

Dan Ariely starts his book Predictably Irrational with the following example. Several years ago, The Economist offered these subscriptions:

**Scenario 1**

|        | Print  | Print + Digital | Digital |
|--------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Price  | $125   | $125            | $59     |

Why is the price for Print and Print + Digital the same? Who would choose the Print option when you get Print + Digital for the same price?
You might think that The Economist could have equivalently just offered these two options:

**Scenario 2**

|        | Print + Digital | Digital |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Price  | $125            | $59     |

You lose virtually nothing. You have the option to get a digital subscription and the option to get a print subscription.

When there are only two options (Print + Digital, Digital), I would prefer the Digital option since it is cheaper and I am mainly interested in the content and not so much how it is delivered. But the existence of the third option, Print, plays an important role. 

> [...] humans rarely choose things in absolute terms. We don't have an internal value meter that tells us how much things are worth. Rather, we focus on the relative advantage of one thing over another, and estimate value accordingly. – Dan Ariely, Predictably Irrational

By adding Print as an option, suddenly Print + Digital becomes more attractive, because it has a clear relative advantage over Print. That there is no absolute advantage does not matter. When as in Scenario 1 all three options are presented, I would be far more likely to choose the more expensive Print + Digital, than in Scenario 2. This is known as the decoy effect and is one of the ways a consumer's decision can be influenced.
